In my opinion, this discussion is about culture, have we already passed the time of downloading apps and being use to always search for new things on App Store or Google Play? For me, no.

I live in a "third world country", so when people here discover new things like Spotify for an example (no, Spotify isn't new here), they rather search Spotify at their device app store than go to spotify.com.

I think PWA (Progressive Web Apps) are much better, unfortunately we are not prepared for it, yet. We already have very good examples of PWA such as <a href="mobile.twitter.com">Twitter Lite</a> with very good devs working on it. Now that Apple is also working with PWA following Steve's speech almost 11 years ago:

Despite all that, I don't know how are we going to organize our apps inside the browser!

The question is, with PWA, will IOS and Android developer jobs die? We as consumers, must get ready for a new app Era where we don't download apps?

Some final considerations, this is my first article so I'm sorry about anything.
